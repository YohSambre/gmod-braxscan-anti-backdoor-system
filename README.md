# braxscan
this is backdoor checking system in garry'smod addons.

original creator : Giraffen93
permission check modify by Zaros#2502

This little script was proposed on the facepunch forum for garry'smod unfortunately the original creator (Giraffen93) never took the time to post it on the workshop or github and the facepunch forum closed down several years ago (so I volunteered to do it), thanks to Zaros for adding the admin condition for typing the concommand. I deleted the functions that caused false positives, however the addon is very greedy when it scans many addons workshop, if it freezes when launching the concommand is perfectly normal.

WARNING: this addon must not be used in game on the client side! you must type the command in the web console (the scan is saved in the data folder if you ever want to read it in your text editor).

INSTALLATION:
throw the 'braxscan-master' folder into the 'addon' folder

COMMANDS:
To scan all addons: braxscan all 1 (ingame console)

SEE LOGS SCAN : 
garrysmod\data\braxscan
